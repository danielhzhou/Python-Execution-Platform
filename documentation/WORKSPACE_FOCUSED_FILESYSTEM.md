# Workspace-Focused Dynamic Filesystem

## Overview
Updated the dynamic filesystem to be **workspace-focused**: the file tree always shows `/workspace` contents regardless of where the user navigates with `cd`, but still tracks current directory for display.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. üéØ Workspace-Only File Tree Refresh
- **File tree always shows `/workspace`** - Never changes to show `/etc`, `/usr`, etc.
- **Selective refresh triggers** - Only refreshes when workspace files actually change
- **Directory tracking continues** - Still shows current directory in header for navigation context

### 2. üîç Smart Command Detection
**Removed triggers for:**
- `cd` commands (directory navigation doesn't affect workspace files)
- `ls` commands (listing doesn't change files)

**Enhanced detection for:**
- File operations that target workspace (`touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, etc.)
- Git operations when in workspace directory
- Archive extractions when in workspace
- Package installations that create files

### 3. üõ°Ô∏è Workspace Boundary Validation
```python
def _affects_workspace(self, command: str, cmd_type: str, session_id: str) -> bool:
    # Check if command targets absolute paths outside workspace
    for arg in command_parts[1:]:
        if arg.startswith('/') and not arg.startswith('/workspace'):
            return False  # Don't refresh for system file operations
    
    # Only refresh if we're in workspace or subdirectory
    current_dir = self.current_directories.get(session_id, '/workspace')
    return current_dir.startswith('/workspace')
```

### 4. üìÇ Behavior Examples

#### ‚úÖ WILL Refresh File Tree:
```bash
cd /workspace/my_project    # Navigate to subdirectory
touch new_file.py          # ‚Üí File tree refreshes (shows workspace files)
mkdir src                  # ‚Üí File tree refreshes
git clone repo.git         # ‚Üí File tree refreshes
tar -xzf archive.tar.gz    # ‚Üí File tree refreshes
```

#### ‚ùå WON'T Refresh File Tree:
```bash
cd /etc                    # Navigate outside workspace
ls -la                     # ‚Üí No refresh (just navigation)
cd ..                      # ‚Üí No refresh (just navigation) 
touch /tmp/test.txt        # ‚Üí No refresh (outside workspace)
cat /etc/passwd            # ‚Üí No refresh (reading system files)
```

#### üìç Directory Display:
- **Header shows**: Current directory (e.g., `./etc`, `./usr/bin`)
- **File tree shows**: Always `/workspace` contents
- **Best of both worlds**: Navigation context + workspace focus

## Benefits

### üéØ **Focused Learning Environment**
- File tree always shows relevant project files
- No confusion when exploring system directories
- Clear separation between navigation and file management

### üöÄ **Performance Optimized**
- Fewer unnecessary refreshes
- Only updates when workspace actually changes
- Maintains responsiveness during system exploration

### üß≠ **Navigation Awareness**
- Still tracks and displays current directory
- Users can see where they are in the system
- Maintains full terminal functionality

### üõ°Ô∏è **Workspace Protection**
- File operations outside workspace don't clutter the tree
- System exploration doesn't interfere with project view
- Clear boundary between workspace and system

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: System Exploration
```bash
cd /etc                    # Header: "./etc"
ls -la                     # File tree: Still shows /workspace
cat passwd                 # File tree: Still shows /workspace
cd /workspace              # Header: Back to workspace
```

### Scenario 2: Project Development
```bash
cd /workspace/my_app       # Header: "./my_app"
mkdir src                  # File tree: Refreshes to show new folder
touch src/main.py          # File tree: Refreshes to show new file
cd src                     # Header: "./my_app/src"
echo "code" > app.py       # File tree: Refreshes to show new file
```

### Scenario 3: Mixed Navigation
```bash
cd /usr/bin                # Header: "./usr/bin" 
ls python*                 # File tree: Still shows workspace
cd /workspace              # Header: Back to workspace
git clone repo.git         # File tree: Refreshes to show cloned repo
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
- **Removed**: `change_dir` and `list_files` from filesystem patterns
- **Added**: `_affects_workspace()` validation method
- **Enhanced**: Command detection to check workspace targeting
- **Maintained**: Directory tracking for navigation display

### Frontend Changes
- **Updated**: Event handler to filter by command type
- **Maintained**: Directory change tracking for header display
- **Optimized**: Only refresh for workspace-affecting commands

## Result
Perfect balance between:
- **üóÇÔ∏è Workspace Focus** - File tree always shows project files
- **üß≠ Navigation Freedom** - Users can explore system freely  
- **üìä Context Awareness** - Always know where you are
- **‚ö° Performance** - No unnecessary refreshes
